# War - The Card Game
### A project by Ashley Taylor

**Description**

This is War! Well, at least the card game of War... thank goodness.  

In War, two players must evenly divide the 52 cards amongst themselves.  At the same time, each player will reveal their top card to the other.  Whomever has the highest cards gets to take both.  However, if the players tie, a war phase begins in which both players will lay down three careds. The last card decides the fate of the round, unless its a tie agian. 

The first player to capture all 52 cards wins!

**Example** 

After creating the card deck from which we pull data, functions like the "Play Function" below drive game play.

Afterward, we view the game from our browser's console in the dev tools.

I welcome suggestions on how to resolve the error messages sent after the game completes about unreadable value, despite the game's ability to compare value in order to finish the game?
